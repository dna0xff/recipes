# Recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner

Some of these will be tech related while others are food. 
Not too hard to work out which is which. 
It's time to move on from the old exercise book that has 
had stuff written in to it for years. Not complaining, it has served well
as a memory jogger but it's easier to share this way and everything
is recorded in a consistent manner. 

Also, this helps create some content to try out a template I am working on.
