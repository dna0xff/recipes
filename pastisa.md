## Pastisa
One of my mothers all time favorite recipes that I have been making on and off for the last 30 years

## Ingredients
### Pasta
500 gm spagetti  
### Meat
500 gm minced steak  
olive oil, tsp oregano, 2 cloves garlic, 2 tbs tomato paste  
### Sauce
90g butter  
5 tbs plain flour  
2 cups milk  
1/2 - 1 cup grated cheese  
2 eggs beaten ( optional )   

## Method
1. **Pasta** Cook spagetti drain & rinse in cold water
2. **Meat**  Fry onion in oil, add garlic, meat & brown. Add remaining ingredients, simmerup to 1 hr 
3. **Sauce** Melt butter & stir in flour. Add milk gradually, season stir untill thickens.
             Remove from heat, allow cool then add cheese and eggs.
4. 1/2 spag on base of dish, cover with meat layer, remaining spag on top.
   Cover with sauce, nutmeg, bake 180c ( 350 F) for 30 min 

## Notes

Sequencing is the hard part for this one. I start with the meat sauce, then move on to the sauce and start the water for the pasta at the same time.
