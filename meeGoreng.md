## Comments
Can use Garam Masala if cannot get Malaysian curry powder. 
Tomato sauce ok, ketchup better.
I use more vegetables ( 2x) and noodles ( 660g), diluting sauce a bit over recepie. Does not scale up well, double sauce is fiery hot!
Perhaps best to make multiple batches ( like a hawker does ) if larger quantity required.
Easier to make sauce by weight if have kitchen scale.
