During recent lockdown we ordered a Sri Lankan Masterclass from Atlas.
We received a box of groceries and online access to the recipes and video tutorials.
What we didn't get is the contents of the **secret sauce**, or in other words the bits that cme pre-prepared. No issue with that, but for adding the recipe tothe knowledgebase you kind on need to know what to put in them. So, this note is to try and fill the gaps with a bit of research.
